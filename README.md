Note: ive decided to forgo 9-point circle detectionas it is far above my skill level. If this was going ot be implimented i would have to hire an expert.

Current Features:
  - kinda accurate calculations for segment strength of a line of warding
  - 4-point and 6-point circle detection (Only lightly tested)

 Next Projects:
 -  Learn GoDot
 -  Create a basic enverment that a VR headset can see
 -  Set up Drawing on the ground
